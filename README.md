üè° Zennova Home - Shopify E-Commerce Website Development
üõ†Ô∏è Private Project ¬∑ Case Study Only

üîç Overview
This document serves as a case study for the end-to-end development, management, and scaling of the Shopify e-commerce platform for Zennova Home, a company specializing in home goods. The project involved a complete digital transformation, from initial setup to ongoing feature enhancement and cross-departmental operational management.

The live website and its theme code are the private property of Zennova Home and are securely stored on Shopify's servers. Therefore, no proprietary source code is shared here.
